# Xplane2Blender_Importer
Blender import script for X-Plane 11. Compatible with Blender 2.8

This is experimental code and there is no guarantee that it will work for all files. Even if it does import a model, you will lose many of the parameters. This script is only useful to import some geometry, you will need to add animations and other properties. This is not a tool to make minor edits to a obj and expect to export it intact.

Do not redistribute models from other authors without permission. 

The original import code is from https://github.com/daveprue/XPlane2Blender
