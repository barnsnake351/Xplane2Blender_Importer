# Xplane2Blender_Importer
Blender import script for X-Plane 11. Compatible with Blender 2.8

This is experimental code and there is no guarantee that it will work for all files. Even if it does import a model, you will lose many of the parameters. This script is only useful to import some geometry, you will need to add animations and other properties. This is not a tool to make minor edits to a obj and expect to export it intact.

If you use plan to distribute any model using this script, please respect the copyright of the original author.

The original import code is from https://github.com/daveprue/XPlane2Blender
